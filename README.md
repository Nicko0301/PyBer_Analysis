# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the total weekly PyBer fares per city type for 2019.

## Results
Urban cities had the highest number of drivers and total rides, and generated the highest total revenue. After urban cities came suburban cities, and finally rural cities. While rural cities generated the least amount of revenue in absolute terms, they did have the highest average fares both per ride and per driver. 

## Summary
Based on the results of our analysis, we propose the following suggestions:
- With rural cities having the highest average fares, we advise focusing resources on expanding operations in rural areas.
- To facilitate growth in the rural ride-sharing market, we recommend offering incentives for drivers, such as sign-on bonuses and bonuses for completing a certain number of rides per week.
- As the number of urban drivers exceeds the number of urban rides, it might make sense to divert some of these drivers to underserved suburban/rural areas.
